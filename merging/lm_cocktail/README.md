## LMCocktail

In this work we used two techinques for data aware model merging. One of them is called LMCocktail which can be found here https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/tree/master/research/LM_Cocktail.

Please clone this repo and setup it up.

Once setup all you have to do is run the code `lmcocktail_merge_align.py`.
